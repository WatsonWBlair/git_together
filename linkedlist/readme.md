Recreate the Linked List data structure by completing the functions in the linkedlist.py file:

- init: Initialize an empty linked list
- addToHead: Add a node to the head of the list
- removeHead: Remove the head of the list
- removeNode: Remove a given node from the list
- addToTail: Add a node to the tail of the list
- addNode: Add a node to the list and a given index
- print: Print the contents of the list

A multiplicity of solutions may be added by creating additional classes in the linkedlist.py file.
