## Hashtable coding challenge
Recreate the hash table data structure by completing the functions in the hashtable.py file:

- init: Initialize a hash table of size n
- hash: Compute a hash code for item
- add: Add item to hash table
- contains: Check if hashtable contains item
- remove: Remove item from hashtable if it exists
- print_hashset: Print the contents of each bucket in hashtable

A multiplicity of solutions may be added by creating additional classes in the hashtable.py file.
