Recreate the Queue data structure by completing the functions in the queue.py file:

- init: Initialize an empty queue
- enqueue: Add an item to the queue
- dequeue: Remove an item from the queue
- queue_size: Return the current size of the queue
- front: Return the next item to be dequeued
- isEmpty: Return True if the queue is empty

> Bonus points will be awarded for expanding this functionality set appropriately.


A multiplicity of solutions may be added by creating additional classes in the queue.py file.
